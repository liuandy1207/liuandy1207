## üí´ About Me

## üéØ Learning Goals
I have a deep love for learning and an equally strong passion for sharing what I learn with others!

There's so much to learn and experience in the world, and never quite enough time in a day (or even a lifetime) to chase it all.

_But that won't stop me from trying._

### I'm currently learning:
- üåü Three.js (for a portfolio site)  <br>
- üåü Python (for a handbook) <br>
- üåü Ukulele (for fun!)
